# Contributing to Rotrust

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Rotrust! This document provides guidelines for contributing to the project and explains our branch protection rules. For more detailed workflow guidelines, please refer to our [WORKFLOW_GUIDELINES.md](WORKFLOW_GUIDELINES.md) document.

## Branch Protection Rules

We have implemented branch protection rules to maintain code quality and prevent accidental changes to the main branch. Here are the key points:

### Main Branch Protection

- **Direct pushes to the main branch are not allowed**
- All changes to the main branch must be made through pull requests
- Pull requests require specific approval before merging
- **Only pull requests approved by the repository owner (MarianStelianCraciun) can be merged to main**

## How to Contribute

1. **Fork the repository** (if you're an external contributor) or create a new branch (if you're a team member)
2. **Make your changes** in your fork or branch
3. **Commit your changes** with clear, descriptive commit messages
4. **Create a pull request** to merge your changes into the main branch
5. **Wait for review** - a team member will review your changes
6. **Address any feedback** from the review
7. Once approved, your changes will be **merged into the main branch**

## Development Workflow

1. Create a new branch for each feature or bugfix
2. Use descriptive branch names (e.g., `feature/user-authentication`, `fix/login-error`)
3. Keep pull requests focused on a single feature or bugfix
4. Write clear commit messages that explain what changes were made and why

## Code Style and Standards

Please follow the existing code style and standards in the project. This includes:

- Consistent indentation and formatting
- Meaningful variable and function names
- Appropriate comments and documentation
- Writing tests for new features

## Questions?

If you have any questions about contributing, please reach out to the project maintainers.
