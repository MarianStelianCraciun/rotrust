## Review Request Message

Hello team,

I've created a PR that adds comprehensive workflow guidelines to improve our development process. These guidelines aim to make our workflow more accurate and concise by providing detailed standards for various aspects of our development process.

### What I'd like you to review:

1. **Completeness**: Are there any important workflow aspects missing from the guidelines?
   
2. **Clarity**: Are the guidelines clear and easy to follow for both new and existing team members?
   
3. **Practicality**: Do these guidelines align with our team's actual practices? Are there any guidelines that might be difficult to implement?
   
4. **Structure**: Is the document well-organized and easy to navigate?

5. **Integration**: Do the references to the new guidelines in CONTRIBUTING.md and README.md make sense and provide clear direction?

### Areas of particular interest:

- The commit message format - is it detailed enough but still practical?
- The branching strategy - does it match our team's preferred approach?
- The PR template - does it capture all the information we need for effective reviews?
- The code review guidelines - do they set the right expectations for both reviewers and authors?

I've tried to follow these guidelines in creating this PR as a demonstration of how they would work in practice.

Thank you for your time and feedback!

Best regards,
[Your Name]
