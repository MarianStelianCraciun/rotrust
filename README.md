@router.post("/transfers/", response_model=dict)
async def transfer_property(transfer_data: TransferRequest):
    try:
        transaction_id = transaction_service.execute_transfer(
            property_id=transfer_data.property_id,
            seller_id=transfer_data.seller_id,
            buyer_id=transfer_data.buyer_id,
