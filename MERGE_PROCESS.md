# Merge Process Summary

## Prerequisites for Merging
1. Pull request has been approved by at least one reviewer
2. All review comments have been addressed
3. All CI checks have passed (if applicable)
4. The branch is up to date with the main branch

## Merge Steps
1. Navigate to the pull request on GitHub: https://github.com/MarianStelianCraciun/rotrust/pull/new/feature/workflow-guidelines

2. Select the appropriate merge method:
   - **Merge commit**: Creates a merge commit that preserves the feature branch history (recommended for this PR)
   - **Squash and merge**: Combines all commits into a single commit
   - **Rebase and merge**: Applies all commits individually without a merge commit

3. Add a merge commit message (if using "Merge commit" option):
   ```
   Merge pull request #X: Add comprehensive workflow guidelines
   
   This adds detailed workflow guidelines to improve the development process
   with more accurate and concise standards.
   ```

4. Click the "Merge pull request" button

5. Confirm the merge

## Post-Merge Cleanup
1. Delete the feature branch after successful merge:
   - Click "Delete branch" button on the PR page
   - Or use command line: `git branch -d feature/workflow-guidelines`

2. Pull the latest changes to local main branch:
   ```
   git checkout main
   git pull origin main
   ```

3. Verify that the changes are correctly reflected in the main branch:
   - Confirm WORKFLOW_GUIDELINES.md exists
   - Check that CONTRIBUTING.md and README.md have been updated with references

## Announcement to Team
After merging, it would be good practice to announce the new workflow guidelines to the team:

```
@channel 

We've just merged new comprehensive workflow guidelines to improve our development process. 
These guidelines provide detailed standards for commits, branches, PRs, code reviews, 
testing, documentation, issue management, and releases.

Please review the new guidelines at:
- [WORKFLOW_GUIDELINES.md](.github/WORKFLOW_GUIDELINES.md)

The guidelines are referenced in:
- [CONTRIBUTING.md](.github/CONTRIBUTING.md)
- [README.md](README.md) (Contributing section)

We'll start following these guidelines for all new contributions. Please reach out if you 
have any questions or suggestions for improvements.
```

## Next Steps
1. Monitor adoption of the new workflow guidelines
2. Collect feedback from team members
3. Iterate and improve the guidelines based on practical experience
4. Consider creating additional tooling to help enforce or automate parts of the workflow
